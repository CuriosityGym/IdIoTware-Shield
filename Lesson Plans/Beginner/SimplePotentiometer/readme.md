  A potentiometer, or "pot" for short, is a control knob.
  It's the same type of control you'd use to change volume,
  dim a lamp, etc. A potentiometer changes resistance as it
  is turned. By using it as a "voltage divider", the Arduino
  can sense the position of the knob, and use that value to
  control whatever you wish.

  In this example we are going to Turn ON and OFF sequence of 12 LEDs
  depending upon the position of the knob of potentiometer.
  As we turn potentiometer from initial position to final position,
  12 LEDs will glow one by one depending to value of potentiometer.
  If we turn knob in reverse direction then LEDs will turn OFF one by
  one depending upon the value of potentiometer

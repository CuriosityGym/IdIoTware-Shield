In this example 12 LEDs are used to show  time.  12 LEDs are connected in circualr pattern. All 12 LEDs represent number 1 to 12 of clock respectively. Depending upon the time, LED of that position will glow.If current time is 4:15 then 4th and 3rd LED will glow. 4th LED will indicate hour and 3rd LED will indicate minutes.LED which shows hours will glow conitinuously. LED which shows minutes will blink with delay of 1 sec. If time 6.30 then hour led and minute led will be the same (6th led) then 6th led will blink with delay of 250 miliseconds. e.g 4.20, 9.45, 11.55. We can set the current time in code.

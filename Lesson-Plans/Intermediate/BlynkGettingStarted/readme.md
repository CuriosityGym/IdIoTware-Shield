#**Getting started with idIoTware Shield and BLYNK.**
#####**Attention: Please install all libraries from our Github Repository to enable this example to run.**
In this example we are using ESP8266-01 Wifi Module.  
     
Blynk is a platform with iOS and Android apps to control Arduino, Raspberry Pi and the likes over the Internet. You can easily build graphic interfaces for all your projects by simply dragging and dropping widgets.  

Downloads, docs, tutorials: http://www.blynk.cc                                                       
Blynk community: http://community.blynk.cc                 

To send data from Blynk to arduino or get data from arduino to blynk app you need to install Blynk app on your smartphone, create account to log in to the app then you will get a unique token number then use that token number in this code to create your own project.

In this example we have used ESP8266_Lib.h and BlynkSimpleShieldEsp8266.h library to make communication between arduino and Blynk app

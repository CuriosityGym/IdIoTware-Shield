# IdIoTware-Shield
##IoT with Arduino, Simplified

The idIoTware (pronounced “eye-dee-eye-oh-tee-ware”) Shield is a learning platform that offers both novices and advanced Arduino users, the opportunity to bring hundreds of projects alive quickly.

idIoTware provides an extremely flexible environment to express ideas and bring interactivity to simple projects, as well as providing for an easy way to implement, learn and prototype advanced projects and applications.


It is the “first of its kind” shield that offers this large variety of wireless communication options, input sensors, outputs and device extensibility. While offering high integration and compactness, the idIoTware Shield offers a large selection of latest hardware and features, accompanied by tested libraries, code and use cases. A must-have for the enthusiastic Arduino user.
